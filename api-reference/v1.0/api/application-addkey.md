# application: addKey

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a key credential to an [application](../resources/application.md). This method, along with [removeKey](application-removekey.md) can be used by an application to automate rolling its expiring keys.

> [!NOTE]
> [Create application](../api/application-post-applications.md) and
[Update application](../api/application-update.md) operations can continue to be used to add and update key credentials for any application with or without a user's context.

As part of the request validation for this method, a proof of possession of an existing key is verified before the action can be performed. 

Applications that don’t have any existing valid certificates (no certificates have been added yet, or all certificates have expired), won’t be able to use this service action. You can use the [Update application](../api/application-update.md) operation to perform an update instead.

## Permissions

|Delegated (work or school account) | None.  |

> [!NOTE] 
> An application does not need any specific permission to roll its own keys.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /applications/{id}/addKey
```

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type   | application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide the following required properties.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| keyCredential | [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) | The new application key credential to add. The __type__, __usage__ and __key__ are required properties for this usage. Supported key types are:<br><ul><li>`AsymmetricX509Cert`: The usage must be `Verify`.</li><li>`X509CertAndPassword`: The usage must be `Sign`</li></ul>|
| passwordCredential | [passwordCredential](../resources/passwordcredential.md) | Only __secretText__ is required to be set which should contain the password for the key. This property is required only for keys of type `X509CertAndPassword`. Set it to `null` otherwise.|
| proof | String | A self-signed JWT token used as a proof of possession of the existing keys. This JWT token must be signed using the private key of one of the application's existing valid certificates. The token should contain the following claims:<ul><li>`aud` - Audience needs to be `00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`.</li><li>`iss` - Issuer needs to be the __id__  of the application that is making the call.</li><li>`nbf` - Not before time.</li><li>`exp` - Expiration time should be "nbf" + 10 mins.</li></ul><br>Here is a code [sample](/graph/application-rollkey-prooftoken) that can be used to generate this proof of possession token. For more information about the claim types, see [Claims payload](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials).|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) object in the response body.
